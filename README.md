This repo is in active development. I am starting this pet project with interests on how neuro-evolution would perform on the Pacman course for which we'd been manually crafting agents.

I already expected that more sophisticated Reinforcement Learning methods were needed like Deep-Q learning for this problem. That hunch turned out to be true as the results on maze-like maps were kind of lackluster. But it does perform well on the small maps where it needs to find pellets, and sometimes on the small maps where it needs to avoid ghosts!

In the code there will be a lot of variables that may be manually changed
